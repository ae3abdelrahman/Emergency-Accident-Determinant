# Emergency-Accident-Determinant
Automation system that analyzes accident data in real time to determine whether an incident qualifies as an emergency. Based on its assessment, it also decides whether human intervention is required or if the situation can be handled automatically.
This project is an advanced automation system designed to determine whether an incident qualifies as an emergency in real time. By leveraging Opus, ChatGPT, with customized AI agents, the platform analyzes incoming calls from individuals involved in the incident and instantly assesses the severity of the situation.
The process begins when one of the parties contacts the system. Multiple AI agents collaboratively evaluate the call using voice analysis, contextual understanding, and incident-classification models. These agents detect signs of emergencies such as injuries, hazardous conditions, or urgent medical needs and determine whether immediate human intervention or first-aid response is required.
If the incident is classified as an emergency, the system automatically triggers escalation protocols, alerts human operators, and prepares essential data for rapid response teams. If no emergency is detected, the platform guides the involved parties to complete the incident report online through a streamlined, automated workflow eliminating unnecessary delays and manual assessments.
This solution transforms incident management by offering faster decision-making, higher accuracy, reduced operational load, and a safer, more efficient response to real-world events.
